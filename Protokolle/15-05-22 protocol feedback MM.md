We met at the meet magento to get a feedback and discuss a few things before meeting of the members happens.

What is the purpose of the association?

- Develope the community in Germany, Europe and worldwide.
- Be an artificial person to host hackathons, conferences, etc.
- Help developing FireGento and hackathon modules

How do we want to do this?

- We need to increase the communication throughput for our members and the community
  - by sending more informations about everything (module success, hackathons, dates, etc.) over the mailinglist
  - by writing more blog articles
  - opening the mailinglist to everybody, so no one get the notice, that his mail is too big, wrong sender address, etc.
  - we want to try with slack
  - CMS page with all our tools

- We want to give trainings

Other things:
- We have to elect the board on the next meeting of the members
- tasks group should think about being more transparent, e.g. by sending reports to the mailinglist, opening the trello, jira, whatever they are using
- We want to add a CMS page about paid support for the differnet modules and add a disclaimer to all FireGento modules
  - this is an open source project and we don't have the resources to give free support to help you with the modules
  - this doesn't mean we don't want to fix bugs, please send us bugs and open issues if you have one
  
Taskgroups:
- Trainings (Rouven, BenniW, AvS)
- Blog (Sonja, Carmen, Tobi)
- Financial planing (Fabian, Nils, Carsten, Benno)
